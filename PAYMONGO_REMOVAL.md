# PayMongo Code Removal Summary

## Files Deleted

### 1. PayMongo Library
- ✅ `/src/lib/paymongo.ts` - PayMongo client and helper functions

### 2. API Routes
- ✅ `/src/app/api/webhooks/paymongo/route.ts` - Webhook handler
- ✅ `/src/app/api/subscription/create-checkout/route.ts` - Checkout creation
- ✅ `/src/app/api/subscription/status/route.ts` - Subscription status

### 3. Frontend Pages
- ✅ `/src/app/organization/subscription/page.tsx` - Subscription management page
- ✅ `/src/app/organization/subscription/success/page.tsx` - Success page (was causing build error)
- ✅ `/src/app/organization/subscription/cancel/page.tsx` - Cancellation page

## Database Schema Changes

### Removed Models
- ✅ `Subscription` model
- ✅ `Payment` model

### Removed Enums
- ✅ `SubscriptionStatus` enum
- ✅ `PaymentStatus` enum

### Updated Models
- ✅ `Organization` - Removed `subscription` relation

## Environment Variables to Remove

Remove these from your `.env` file:

```bash
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...
PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsk_...
```

## Documentation Files

You can optionally delete:
- `PAYMONGO_SETUP.md` - Setup instructions for PayMongo

## Next Steps

### 1. Update Database Schema

Run this to sync the database (removes Subscription and Payment tables):

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

**⚠️ WARNING**: This will delete the `Subscription` and `Payment` tables and all their data!

### 2. Regenerate Prisma Client

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### 3. Test Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The build error about `/organization/subscription/success` should now be resolved since that page has been deleted.

## What Was Kept

- ✅ All ticket management functionality
- ✅ All email functionality
- ✅ All organization/company management
- ✅ All authentication
- ✅ All activity logging
- ✅ Forgot password with OTP

## Impact

- No more subscription/billing functionality
- No more PayMongo integration
- Cleaner codebase focused on core ticketing features
- Build errors resolved

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to restore PayMongo functionality, you can:
1. Revert the git commit
2. Run `git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/lib/paymongo.ts src/app/api/subscription src/app/organization/subscription`
3. Restore the Prisma schema changes
4. Run `npx prisma db push`
