# Activity Log Updates - Ticket Changes Tracking

## Overview
All ticket field updates now automatically create activity log entries that appear in the ticket detail page's activity timeline.

## What's Logged

```

### âœ… Assignment Changes
```
"Assigned to John Doe"
"Unassigned"
```

### âœ… Deadline Changes
```
"Deadline set to Monday, December 25, 2024"
"Deadline cleared"
```

### âœ… Company Changes
```

```

### âœ… Tags Changes
```
"Tags updated: urgent, bug, frontend"
```

## Implementation Details

### Location
**File**: `/src/app/actions-new.ts`
**Function**: `updateTicket()`

### How It Works

1. **Ticket Update**: Field is updated in database
2. **Activity Log Creation**: Automatically creates log entry
3. **Display**: Log appears in ticket detail page activity section
4. **Timestamp**: Uses current date/time
5. **User**: Currently logs as "System" (can be enhanced to track actual user)

### Code Structure

```typescript
// After ticket update, before return
try {
    const activityLogs: Array<{ type: string; details: string }> = [];

    // Check each field for changes
    if (data.priority !== undefined) {
        activityLogs.push({
            type: 'Update',
            details: `Priority changed to ${data.priority}`
        });
    }
    
    // ... similar for other fields

    // Create all activity logs
    for (const log of activityLogs) {
        await addActivityLog(organizationId, id, {
            type: log.type,
            details: log.details,
            date: new Date().toISOString(),
            user: 'System',
            ticketSubject: updatedTicket.subject
        });
    }
} catch (logError) {
    console.error('Error adding activity logs:', logError);
    // Don't fail the update if logging fails
}
```

## Activity Log Entry Structure

Each log entry contains:
- **Type**: "Update" (for field changes)
- **Details**: Human-readable description of the change
- **Date**: ISO timestamp of when change occurred
- **User**: Who made the change (currently "System")
- **Ticket Subject**: Subject of the ticket being updated

## User Experience

### Before
- Change priority from "Low" to "High"
- No activity log entry created
- Activity section doesn't show the change

### After
- Change priority from "Low" to "High"
- âœ… Activity log entry created: "Priority changed to High"
- âœ… Appears in ticket detail page activity timeline
- âœ… Shows timestamp of change
- âœ… Multiple changes create multiple log entries

## Example Activity Timeline

```
ðŸ“‹ Activity

[Today at 2:45 PM]
Priority changed to High

[Today at 2:45 PM]
Deadline set to Monday, December 25, 2024

[Today at 2:30 PM]
Assigned to John Doe

[Today at 2:15 PM]
Status changed to Open

[Today at 2:00 PM]
Ticket created from email
```

## Automatic Deadline Logging

When priority changes trigger automatic deadline updates:

**Example**: Change priority to "High" (2-day deadline)
```
Activity logs created:
1. "Priority changed to High"
2. "Deadline set to Monday, December 25, 2024"
```

Both changes are logged separately for complete audit trail.

## Error Handling

### Safe Failure
- If activity logging fails, ticket update still succeeds
- Error is logged to console
- User sees successful update toast
- No disruption to user experience

### Database Queries
- Fetches assignee name for assignment logs
- Fetches company name for company logs
- Uses fallback values if lookup fails

## Benefits

1. **Complete Audit Trail**: Every change is tracked
2. **User Transparency**: Users can see all changes made to ticket
3. **Debugging**: Easy to trace when and what changed
4. **Accountability**: Know who made what changes (when user tracking added)
5. **Historical Context**: Understand ticket evolution over time

## Related Features

- **Ticket Creation**: Already logs "Ticket created from email/portal"
- **Email Replies**: Logs "Reply sent" when agent responds
- **Status Changes**: Now logs status updates
- **Priority Changes**: Now logs priority updates with deadline changes

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **User Tracking**: Replace "System" with actual user who made change
   ```typescript
   user: currentUser.email // Instead of 'System'
   ```

2. **Old vs New Values**: Show what changed from/to
   ```
   "Priority changed from Low to High"
   "Status changed from Open to Resolved"
   ```

3. **Bulk Updates**: Log when multiple tickets updated at once
   ```
   "Bulk update: 5 tickets assigned to John Doe"
   ```

4. **Undo Capability**: Allow reverting changes from activity log
   ```
   [Undo] button next to each log entry
   ```

5. **Activity Filters**: Filter by type, user, date range
   ```
   Show only: [Priority Changes] [Status Changes] [Assignments]
   ```

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Single Field Update**
   - Change priority
   - âœ… Check activity log shows "Priority changed to X"

2. **Multiple Fields Update**
   - Change priority and status together
   - âœ… Check activity log shows both changes

3. **Automatic Deadline**
   - Change priority to "High"
   - âœ… Check activity log shows priority AND deadline changes

4. **Assignment Change**
   - Assign ticket to agent
   - âœ… Check activity log shows "Assigned to [Name]"

5. **Unassignment**
   - Remove assignee
   - âœ… Check activity log shows "Unassigned"

6. **Deadline Clear**
   - Change priority to "None"
   - âœ… Check activity log shows "Deadline cleared"

## Troubleshooting

### Activity Log Not Showing

**Check:**
1. Ticket detail page is refreshing/reloading
2. Activity log component is rendering
3. Database has activity log entries
4. No console errors in browser/server

### Wrong Information in Log

**Check:**
1. Field mapping functions are correct
2. User/company lookups are working
3. Date formatting is correct
4. Activity log query is correct

### Duplicate Entries

**Check:**
1. Update function not called multiple times
2. No duplicate activity log creation
3. Frontend not making duplicate API calls

## Database Schema

### ActivityLog Table
```prisma
model ActivityLog {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())
  organizationId  String
  ticketId        String
  ticketSubject   String?
  type            String   // "Create", "Update", "Reply", etc.
  details         String   // Human-readable description
  userId          String   // Who made the change
  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
}
```

- âœ… Type changes
- âœ… Assignment changes
- âœ… Deadline changes
- âœ… Company changes
